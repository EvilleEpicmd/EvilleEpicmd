- 👋 Hi, I’m @EvilleEpicmd
- 👀 I’m now mostly interested in medical computing, mostly Epic, but started with BASIC, FORTRAN, Turbo Pascal.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring new (to me) general programming approaches, understanding databases such as Snowflake. 
- 💞️ I’m happy to provide a medical perspective on computing problems if you are looking for a medical collaborator.
- 📫 How to reach me Email at evilledrwho@aol.com
